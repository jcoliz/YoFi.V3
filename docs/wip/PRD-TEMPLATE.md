## Technical Approach (Optional)

[Brief description of the intended technical approach, if you have one in mind]

**Layers Affected**:
- [ ] Frontend (Vue/Nuxt)
- [ ] Controllers (API endpoints)
- [ ] Application (Features/Business logic)
- [ ] Entities (Domain models)
- [ ] Database (Schema changes)

**High-Level Entity Concepts**:

**[EntityName] Entity** (new or modified):
- PropertyName (description - what it represents, required/optional)
- PropertyName (description)
- PropertyName (description)

[Add more entities as needed]

**Key Business Rules**:
1. **Rule Name** - Description of business rule that affects user experience
2. **Rule Name** - Description of business rule
3. [Add more business rules that belong in PRD scope]

**Code Patterns to Follow**:
- Entity pattern: [`BaseTenantModel`](../src/Entities/Models/BaseTenantModel.cs) or [`BaseModel`](../src/Entities/Models/BaseModel.cs)
- CRUD operations: [`TransactionsController.cs`](../src/Controllers/TransactionsController.cs) and [`TransactionsFeature.cs`](../src/Application/Features/TransactionsFeature.cs)
- Tenant-scoped authorization: Existing pattern with `[RequireTenantRole]`
- Testing: NUnit with Gherkin comments (Given/When/Then)
