# TODO: There is a subtle bug here. The front end requires `app/assets/version.txt`
# which is generated by building the backend. In CI, we need to ensure the backend is built
# before building the front end. This is currently not handled properly.
#
# Better would be to generate the version.txt file here in the front end build stage,
# using the `Get-Version.ps1` script.
