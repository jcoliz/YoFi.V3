# Backend API

This folder contains a C# generated API client for the back end.

I don't love how it's generated, but I could not get it to work a better way, so leaving it alone for now.

The C# file here is built and placed here by the WireApiHost project, and we check it into source control so it's always here.

Better would be that we generate it HERE into our obj directory... But that's not working.
