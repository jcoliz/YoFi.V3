# YoFi.V3

[![Build](https://github.com/jcoliz/YoFi.V3/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jcoliz/YoFi.V3/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

This is the beginning of a structural refactor/rewrite of the [YoFi](https://github.com/jcoliz/yofi) project. YoFi was originally started on .NET Core 2.2, so it's time to modernize!

Currently, I'm collecting domain-independent building blocks of a more modern web stack. Once this is all together and working, I will start bringing actual YoFi code over to this project.

## Technology Stack
